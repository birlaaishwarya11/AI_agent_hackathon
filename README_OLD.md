# PhenoML Healthcare Query Processing System

A comprehensive system for processing healthcare queries using PhenoML AI to generate structured appointment booking data compatible with FHIR standards.

## Overview

This system integrates OpenAI language understanding with PhenoML's healthcare-specific AI capabilities to:

1. **Process natural language healthcare queries** from patients
2. **Analyze symptoms** using clinical guidelines and medical knowledge
3. **Assess urgency and severity** levels for proper care routing
4. **Generate structured JSON output** compatible with FHIR appointment booking standards
5. **Route patients** to appropriate care levels (primary care, urgent care, emergency, specialists)

### Python API

```python
from phenoml_integration import PhenoMLClient, HealthcareQueryProcessor

# Initialize client
client = PhenoMLClient()
processor = HealthcareQueryProcessor(client)

# Process a query
query = "I've been having severe headaches for 3 days with nausea"
result = processor.process_query(query)

print(f"Priority: {result['appointment_data']['priority_level']}")
print(f"Appointment Type: {result['appointment_data']['appointment_request']['appointment_type']}")
```

## JSON Output Schema

The system generates structured JSON output with the following key sections:

### Patient Information
```json
{
  "patient_info": {
    "age_range": "18-35",
    "gender": "female",
    "pregnancy_status": "unknown",
    "chronic_conditions": ["hypertension"]
  }
}
```

### Symptoms Assessment
```json
{
  "symptoms_assessment": {
    "primary_symptoms": [
      {
        "symptom": "severe headache",
        "body_system": "neurological",
        "severity": "severe"
      }
    ],
    "severity": "high",
    "duration": "acute",
    "red_flags": ["severe headache with nausea"]
  }
}
```

### Appointment Request
```json
{
  "appointment_request": {
    "appointment_type": "urgent_care",
    "specialty_required": "neurology",
    "urgency": "within_24h",
    "appointment_reason": "Severe headache evaluation"
  }
}
```

### Clinical Guidelines
```json
{
  "clinical_guidelines": {
    "applicable_guidelines": [
      {
        "guideline_name": "International Headache Society Guidelines",
        "organization": "IHS",
        "relevance": "primary"
      }
    ],
    "recommendations": ["Neurological examination", "Consider imaging if red flags present"]
  }
}
```

## Example Scenarios

The system includes comprehensive test scenarios:

### 1. Emergency Scenario
**Query**: "I'm having severe chest pain radiating to my left arm with nausea"
**Output**: Emergency priority, immediate cardiology consultation

### 2. Routine Care
**Query**: "I've had a persistent cough for 2 weeks"
**Output**: Primary care appointment within a week

### 3. Mental Health
**Query**: "I've been feeling anxious and can't sleep for 3 weeks"
**Output**: Mental health appointment, psychiatry referral

### 4. Pediatric Care
**Query**: "My 8-year-old has fever and sore throat for 2 days"
**Output**: Urgent care, pediatric evaluation

## Testing

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
python -m unittest test_framework.py
```

- Considers patient demographics in assessment
- Provides confidence scores for assessments

## Limitations

- This system provides **clinical decision support** and should not replace professional medical judgment
- All outputs should be reviewed by qualified healthcare professionals
